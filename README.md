# 📌 RESTful Task Manager API – Assignment Project

## 📄 Project Overview

This is a **backend development assignment** given by **Osumare Marketing Solutions**, focused on building a **simple RESTful API** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
The API manages a collection of tasks (like a To-Do app) with features like:

- Basic **CRUD operations**  
- **Pagination**, **sorting**, and **authorization** (Bonus)
- In-memory storage (no database)

This project helped solidify my knowledge of Express, middleware, routing, and REST principles.

## ✨ Features

- `GET /tasks` – Get all tasks with pagination and sorting  
- `GET /tasks/:id` – Get a task by ID  
- `POST /tasks` – Add a new task  
- `PUT /tasks/:id` – Fully update a task  
- `PATCH /tasks/:id` – Partially update a task  
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` – Delete a task  
- 🔐 Middleware-based **authorization** for selected endpoints  
- 🧪 Fully tested using **Postman**

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building and structuring RESTful APIs in Express.js
- Working with **middleware**, **routing**, and **request/response lifecycle**
- How to apply **pagination, filtering, sorting** using query params
- Handling **authorization** via custom middleware
- Using `.find()`, `.filter()`, `.some()` for array-based logic
- Preparing professional project documentation
